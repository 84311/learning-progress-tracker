# Learning Progress Tracker 
Learning Progress Tracker is a simple console app created as part of the JetBrains Academy Java Backend Developer course - https://hyperskill.org/projects/197?track=12.<br><br>
It keeps track of the registered users, their learning progress, and metrics. It will also provide detailed information about each user or any category of users and the overall statistics for the entire learning platform. The data is not saved and only exists in the current session.<br><br>
It has no features other than those required by the tests provided by JetBrains. Nevertheless, I wrote my own tests.

## How to run the app
1. Clone Git Repository.
2. Run project.

## Features
- adding students
